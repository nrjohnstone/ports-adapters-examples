# WebService Client 2  - Acceptance Tests

This console application serves as a simple test harness that can verify desired functionality from an external perspective (also known as blackbox testing)

Before running the acceptance tests make sure all dependencies are up by running docker compose and the
required Web Service for Client 2 is also running.
