# WebService Client 2  - Acceptance Tests

This console application serves as a simple test harness that can verify desired functionality from an external perspective
(also known as blackbox testing or end-to-end testing)

Before running the acceptance tests make sure all dependencies are up by running docker compose and the
required Web Service for Client 2 is also running.
